    I have hand selected some works from my undergrad career that can be found here. All of these works were created for educational purposes and are intended to demonstrate various skill sets. I have some basic Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop skills, which can be found in the graphics section, and a few samples of mock marketing pitches and campiagn drafts can also be found here. Please feel free to browse!
